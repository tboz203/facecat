    puts together query with self._email
    regex for '/profile.php\?id=\d+'
    doesn't find it...

    sets fbid to 0

"GetWall"
    gets wall.php
    "Comments" or "See More" (?)
    regex for '"/story.php\?story_fbid.*"'
    > we've inserted a ? on that .* before, bc that's a hellofa match
    regex for '</strong></a>.*[a-zA-Z0-9+/=]'

    first regex matches, second one doesn't
    grabs two links out (it looks like)
    > lines 236-238
    "Cookie" (if m1 or m2, we have m1)
    does two substitutions, removing tags and whitespace
    regex for '-\[[a-zA-Z0-9+/=]+\]' (-[*base64*], methinks)
    no match found (because we haven't put a cookie on the wall...)
    and then it returns...

so we're back at the module level...
and it starts doing stuff with raw sockets??
reads data off the socket, writes it to facebook. why.
is this an internal piece in a different connection?
it looks like it pulls data from another connection, and sends *that* to
facebook. so by itself, this program doesn't do anything. it needs to pull in
data from **another** connection, and bounces that to facebook.

it looks for the first post on the given wall, and tries to use it as a cookie.
**only if it doesn't find a post will it try to create a new one** It also
seems to have some issues w/ posting to the wall. i may have to break apart the
webpage to get it to work...

---

#### two issues:
- the data isn't getting extracted from the form correctly. i don't
  know what needs to be there, but i know it isn't that. i tried to go and
  capture some raw traffic to see what happens when i share a status, but
  facebook forces https and i don't have the time to try and decrypt all that. so
  methinks i'm just going to trial-and-error it... fuck

- the search for host page won't work correctly. it looks for
  'profile.php?id=XXX', but that's not always how it works. if you're host, it
  works fine. I don't know if we can make it work without, but i'm going to
  try.
